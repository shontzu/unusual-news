      On the fifth of March 3001, at 9am in the morning, eight thousand people gathered around a private launching platform to
      witness the launching of Space-Z to planet Saturn. However, things went South when an odd piece of object seem to
      dismantle and fall off the sky as the rocket took off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piece of metal pivoted through the air, and was blown off by the strong wind. Within the next two hours, the
      team managed to track down the dislocated piece of metal five miles away from the launching station. It was found,
      luckily, on an empty grass field, causing no more damage than some unearthed grass and debris.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is not it. While scientists are securing the area down, the piece of metal promptly exploded in flames. For
      the second lucky time, not hurting anybody who is at the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rocket reportedly flew off into space with no trouble despite that strange piece of metal dismantling off the
      rocket body. The remnants of the burnt material has been sent to the laboratory for investigation. Crew members
      flying the rocket has not reported any technical difficulties in the rocket, leaving many puzzled as to what that
      piece of metal was that fell off the sky when the rocket took off.
